    Hi, my name is Cole Grizzell! I am a rising junior in the finance program at BYU. I am originally from the Chicago area, and I have been living in Provo for about a year, after coming home from my mission in NJ/NY last July. I am going to be an investment banking summer analyst for Jefferies Financial Group, working with the energy team in Houston, Texas next summer. I will be taking the opportunity to talk a bit about investment banking on this site, explaining what it is and why I am interested in doing it as a career for the forseeable future.<br><br><br>
